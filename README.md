*Break Breaker:*

     Brick breaker is a classic arcade game that involves breaking bricks by bouncing a ball on a paddle. As a 16-bit assembly language game, it was likely developed for
     a retro gaming platform, such as an early home computer or game console. Here's a breakdown of how i implemented this game:

1. Initializing the game: When the game starts, the program would likely first initialize the graphics and sound systems, as well as any necessary data structures (such as an array to hold the bricks). It may also display a main menu, allowing the player to choose options like starting the game, reading instructions, or quitting.

2. Playing the game: Once the player chooses to start the game, the program would enter the main game loop. This loop would update the position of the ball and paddle each frame based on user input and collision detection. The program would also check for collisions between the ball and the bricks and remove any bricks that are hit. The game loop would continue until the player clears all the bricks or loses all their lives.

3. Handling user input: The game would likely respond to user input via the keyboard or game controller. For example, the player could move the paddle left or right to control its position or press a button to pause the game or use a power-up item.

4. Displaying graphics: The program would need to display graphics for the game elements, such as the bricks, ball, and paddle. This would involve drawing sprites on the screen and updating their position each frame. The program may also display a score counter and other UI elements.

5. Playing sound: To enhance the player's experience, the game may include sound effects and background music. The program would need to play audio files and trigger sound effects at appropriate times during gameplay.

6. Pause Screen: By pressing the esc key the pause screen will occur and when u press any other key the pause screen will exit.
